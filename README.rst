Leabharlann
===========

Leabharlann_ is an a CLI tool to keep track of books I'm reading or want to read.
The purpose of this is to have a centralised point of doing this, rather than my usual
approach of scattering my reading lists across notebooks, post-its, and the occasional
draft email.

Leabharlann is the Irish word for library.
